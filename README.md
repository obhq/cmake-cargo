# cmake-cargo

This is a CMake package to integrate [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo) into your CMake project. It will allows you to use any Rust crates from C/C++. This package use a different approach from [Corrosion](https://github.com/corrosion-rs/corrosion) that I believe our implementation are more natural to use and less hacky than Corrosion.

This requires CMake 3.31+.
